# deno 101

After completing my full stack bootcamp, I ended up on a fully front end path. While I do wish to continue specializing as a front end developer, I am taking some courses to keep awareness of the backend process sharp. Also hoping that early adoption with Deno might pay off a few years down the road if it catches on.
